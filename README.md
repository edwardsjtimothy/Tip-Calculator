# Tip-Calculator

Hello! Here is my tip calculator. I used Bootstrap and Jquery for the html interface along with the Popper.js library for the error message popover. I used these libraries to add functionality and aesthetics to the browser UI. While working on this application, I learned that input fields with the number type don't like decimal points if they come from an html keyboard, at least the way I implemented one, so I found a work around. Numbers submitted from the keyboard do not seem to encounter the same issues and function properly.
